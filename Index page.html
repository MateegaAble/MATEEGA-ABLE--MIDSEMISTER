    <h4>I being a student of Computing school and iformatics, let me briefly talk about it;</h4>
    <p>the shool of computing favours or occupies the most part in academic learning as its comprised of major courses like introduction to computing skills among the rest,
        it has alot of holistic activities that favour learning as students learn different activities such as;
        <ol>
            <li>coding</li>
            <li>designing websites</li>
            <li>hucking</li>
            <li>systems maintainance and design</li>

        </ol>
        and above all, students are shaped into positionds to atart their own jobs but not t to look for jobs after the academic journey.
