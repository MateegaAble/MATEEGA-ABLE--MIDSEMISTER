    <title>WHAT CSS IS IN WEB DEVELOPMENT.</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>CSS is a key element in website development.</h1>
    <P>First of all, CSS is a simple mechanism for adding styles in a web page.</P>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
    separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
    characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
    which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the
    page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting</p>
<p>"CSS class" redirects here. For non-CSS use of element classes in HTML, see class attribute (HTML).
In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup
itself.

Selectors may apply to the following:

all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
elements specified by attribute, in particular:
id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash prefix e.g. #id
class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefix e.g. .classname</p>
